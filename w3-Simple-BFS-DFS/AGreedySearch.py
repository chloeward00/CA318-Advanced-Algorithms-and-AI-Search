    # For this exercise, you don't create a program, just return 3 items:
    # What items? Three items:
    #   1. length of the path the the greedy algorithm found
    #   2. the node (as a string) that the algorithm actually reached (this could be the goal)
    #   3. A boolean value indicating whether the greedy search actually finished
    # e.g.
    #return 5, "1238 4756", True
    #215637 84" -> "2436 1875"
    return 6,"2 5613847", False
