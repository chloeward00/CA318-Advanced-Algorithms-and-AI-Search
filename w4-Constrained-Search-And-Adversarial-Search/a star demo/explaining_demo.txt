At the start of my program in the a star file, the start and goal word is given by the user.
which is then passed into my WordGameNode.py. This program takes various functions from 
the wordgamenode program such as heuristic that helps calculate the cost of shortest path 
from the goal word that the user inputs.

In the a_star_search, the function is used to determine 
the path that the program takes getting to the goal word via 
the start word. In this function the children are sorted by scores.
 I have also used a set for the visited as I learned from my previous 
demo that a set() makes it more efficient, which makes sense as my run time for 
this program is significantly faster than it was for my last demo.
