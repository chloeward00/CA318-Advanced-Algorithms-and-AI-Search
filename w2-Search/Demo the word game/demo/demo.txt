So the start word and goal word are passed into the WordGameNode. Then BFS is used to track the child words starting from the “start” word up until the “goal” word is found. Number of searches is also taken into account to see how many words are there in the path to get to the goal position. The path is also printed to show the parent nodes that were visited through each iteration. Our code also shows the time it takes to get to the goal position via the start position.
